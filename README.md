This repository is a Database work, which we had to learn on our own how to use the MongoDB API with Python, to later make queries and be able to use it in the final December work.

## Instructions

The teacher indicated a series of steps and criteria which we should follow in order to carry out the work:

```
Write a program that connects to the MongoDB Atlas Data API

As a starting point, follow these steps:

* Connect to the atlas web interface
* Follow the "Data API" link on the left side navigation bar.
* Create an API key
* Choose your database and collection
* Change the URL to Python in the dropdown
* Copy the python code
* Modify the code so that it prints all the fields of all the documents of your bicycle database.
```
